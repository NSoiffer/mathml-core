<h2>Rationale for a new version of MathML</h2>

<div id="mathml3diff.p2">
  <p>The <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11">auto</a>]</cite>
    specification has several shortcomings that make it hard to implement
    consistently accross web rendering engines or to extend with user-defined
    constructions e.g.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is a huge and standalone specification.</li>
    <li>It does not contain any detailed rendering rules.</li>
    <li>It is not driven by browser-implementation.</li>
    <li>It lacks automated testing.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="mathml3diff.p4">
  <p>This <em>MathML Core</em> specification intends to address these issues by
    being as accurate as possible on the visual rendering of mathematical
    formulas using additional rules from the TeXBookâ€™s Appendix G
    <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx16">auto</a>]</cite> and from
    the Open Font Format <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13">auto</a>]</cite>.
    It also relies on modern browser implementations and web technologies
    <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx9">auto</a>]</cite> clarifying interactions
    with them when needed or introducing new low-level primitives to improve
    the web platform layering.
    Parts of MathML 3 that do not fit well in this framework or are rarely used
    in practice have been omitted. Instead, they are described in a separate
    and larger
    <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11bis">auto</a>]</cite> specification.</p>
</div>

<div id="mathml3diff.p5">
  <p>
    By increasing the level of implementation details, focusing on a
    workable subset, following a browser-driven design and relying on
    automated <a href="bib.html#bibwpt">auto</a> tests, this specification is
    expected to greatly improve MathML interoperability.
    Moreover, effort on MathML layering will enable users to implement the
    rest of the MathML 4 specification, or more generally to extend MathML Core,
    using polyfills or converters.

<div id="keywords">
<p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,

<p>This document relies on many definitions taken from the MATH specification
of the Open Font Format <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13">auto</a>]</cite>. These values are written with
the following style:
