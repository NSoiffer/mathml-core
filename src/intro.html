<h2>Rationale for a new version of MathML</h2>

  <p>The <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11">auto</a>]</cite>
    specification has several shortcomings that make it hard to implement
    consistently accross web rendering engines:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is a huge and standalone specification.</li>
    <li>It does not contain any detailed rendering rules.</li>
    <li>It is not driven by browser-implementation.</li>
    <li>It lacks automated testing.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div id="mathml3diff.p4">
  <p>This <em>MathML Core</em> specification intends to address these issues by
    being as accurate as possible on the visual rendering of mathematical
    formulas using additional rules from the TeXBookâ€™s Appendix G
    <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx16">auto</a>]</cite> and from
    the Open Font Format <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13">auto</a>]</cite>.
    It also relies on modern browser implementations and web technologies
    <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx9">auto</a>]</cite>, extending them or
    clarifying interactions when needed.
    Parts of MathML 3 that do not fit well in this framework or are rarely used
    in practice have been ommited and moved into a larger specification
    <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11bis">auto</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>

<div id="mathml3diff.p5">
<p>By increasing the level of implementation details and by focusing more on
  browser-driven design, this specification is expected to greatly improve
  MathML interoperability. A test suite is available in the
   <a href="bib.html#bibwpt">auto</a> repository.

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<div id="keywords">
<p>The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT,
RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, are to be interpreted as described in
<cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx10">auto</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>

<div id="openfontformat">
<p>This document relies on many definitions taken from the MATH specification
of the Open Font Format <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13">auto</a>]</cite>. These values are written with
the following style:
<span class="MATH">This is a definition from the MATH specification</span>.</p>
