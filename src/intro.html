<h2>Rationale for a new version of MathML</h2>

  <p>The <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11">auto</a>]</cite>
    specification has
two serious shortcomings that make it hard to implement presentation MathML in
web rendering engines:</p>

<li id="I1.i1">
<div id="I1.i1.p1">
<p><span>The MathML 3 specification intentionally does not contain any detailed
rendering rules</span>. As a consequence, the fact that web rendering engines are
compliant with the MathML 3 specification does not necessarily mean that they
will have the rendering quality expected by most readers.
For example, the specification essentially just says that
“mfrac element is used for fractions” and that the default medium
linethickness “is left up to the rendering agent” <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11">auto</a>]</cite>.
As a comparison, to determine the exact spacing and thickness of
fractions and stacks the
TeXBook’s Appendix G <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx16">auto</a>]</cite> relies on parameters
σ<sub>8</sub>, σ<sub>9</sub>, ξ<sub>8</sub>, 3ξ<sub>8</sub>, 7ξ<sub>8</sub>,
σ<sub>11</sub> and σ<sub>12</sub> while the MATH table of the Open Font Format
<cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13">auto</a>]</cite> extends these to parameters
<code class="MATH">FractionNumeratorDisplayStyleShiftUp</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionNumeratorShiftUp</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionNumeratorDisplayStyleGapMin</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionNumeratorGapMin</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionRuleThickness</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionDenominatorDisplayStyleGapMin</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionDenominatorGapMin</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionDenominatorDisplayStyleShiftDown</code>,
<code class="MATH">FractionDenominatorShiftDown</code>,
<code class="MATH">StackTopDisplayStyleShiftUp</code>,
<code class="MATH">StackTopShiftUp</code>,
<code class="MATH">StackDisplayStyleGapMin</code>,
<code class="MATH">StackGapMin</code>,
<code class="MATH">StackBottomDisplayStyleShiftDown</code> and
<code class="MATH">StackBottomShiftDown</code>.</p>

<p><span>The MathML 3 specification is designed as an independent
XML language and browser vendors have almost not been involved in the
standardization process</span>. The Math WG and WHATWG worked together to
integrate MathML in <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx9">auto</a>]</cite>
but MathML3 has inconsistencies and lacks of details when it comes to
interaction with CSS / HTML5 features: vertical writing mode,
user stylesheet, <code>mstyle</code> inheritance, out-of-flow elements,
attributes sensitiveness, definition of space characters...
The MathML 3 specification is sometimes biased by MathML rendering and
authoring tools behaving quite differently from web rendering engines.
Hence it is not always obvious whether all features are fundamental or
whether they fit well into the web rendering engine codebase
<cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11">auto</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="mathml3diff.p4">
<p>This "MathML Core" specification intends to address these issues by
being as accurate as
possible on the visual rendering of mathematical formulas using additional
rules from the TeXBook’s Appendix G <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx16">auto</a>]</cite> and from
the Open Font Format <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13">auto</a>]</cite>.
Focus has been put on keeping compatible with existing technologies of web
rendering engines <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx9">auto</a>]</cite> by relying as much as possible on CSS, text &amp;
table layout and box models. As a consequence, parts of MathML 3
that do not fit well in this framework or are rarely used in practice
have been ommited and moved into a larger specification
<cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11bis">auto</a>]</cite>.</p>

<div id="mathml3diff.p5">
<p>By increasing the level of implementation details and by focusing more on
  browser-driven design, this specification is expected to greatly improve
  MathML interoperability. A
  <a href="http://www.w3c-test.org/mathml/">auto</a>
  is available in a separate
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/tree/master/mathml">auto</a>. Browser vendors are encouraged to use these tests during
  implementation &amp; automated testing. Contribution of new tests and error
  reports are welcome.</p>
