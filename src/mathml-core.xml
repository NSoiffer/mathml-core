<abstract>
  <p>This specification defines a core subset of Mathematical Markup Language,
  or MathML. MathML is a markup language for describing mathematical notation
  and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable
  mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just
  as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.</p>
  <p>Compared with prior versions of MathML, this specification tries to be as
  accurate as possible on the visual rendering of mathematical formulas using
  additional rules from the TeXBook’s Appendix G
  <cite>[<a href="#bibx16" title="">TeXBook</a>]</cite> and from the Open Font
  Format version 3
  <cite>[<a href="#bibx13" title="">OpenFontFormat3</a>]</cite>.
  It also focuses on compatibility with existing technologies of web
  rendering engines <cite>[<a href="#bibx9" title="">HTML5</a>]</cite>
  by relying as much as possible on CSS, text &amp; table layout and
  box models.</p>

 <h1>Relax NG</h1>
 <p>This section displays a non-normative Relax NG Schema which
 details the elements and attributes defined by this specification.
 Note that MathML does not need to be expressed in XML syntax, in
 particular the syntax defined by HTML may be used. However this
 schema may be taken as an informal specification of the structure,
 whatever syntax is used.</p>
