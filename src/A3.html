<p>It is not clear how the <code>DisplayOperatorMinHeight</code> is
supposed to be used or whether it is really reliable. More specifically,
integral symbols (e.g. INTEGRAL U+222B) are typically taller than N-ary
operators (e.g. N-ARY SUMMATION U+2211) so a unique minimal height may not
always be enough to determine the display size. Suppose for example that the
sum has three size variants: the base size of height 1em, the display size
of height 2em and a bigger variant of height 3em.
Suppose that the integral has three sizes: a base size of
height 1em, a larger size variant of height 2em and a display size of height
3em. If <code>DisplayOperatorMinHeight</code> is less than
3em then it does not force the display size of the integral to be selected.
If it is more than 3em then none of the available sizes satisfies the
condition. How to interpret that? Should we pick the largest as a fallback?
If it is 3em, the desired size will be selected for the integral in display
size but the one selected for the sum in display size will be too large.
A heuristic is proposed in section <a href="S3.html#SS2.SSS4" title="3.2.4 Operator, Fence, Separator or Accent &lt;mo&gt; ‣ 3.2 Token Elements ‣ 3 Presentation Markup "><span>3.2.4</span></a> to workaround limitations
of <code>DisplayOperatorMinHeight</code>.</p>

<p>The OpenType MATH specification does not seem to take into account
linebreaking. As explained in section <a href="S3.html#SS1.SSS2" title="3.1.2 Layout Steps ‣ 3.1 Introduction ‣ 3 Presentation Markup "><span>3.1.2</span></a> it is important in a
HTML5 context to be able to determine the min-content width and the max-content
width. However when an operator is stretched vertically to cover a target size,
it is not possible to know the selected size variant or glyph assembly without
knowing the target size and so the min-content and max-content widths can only
be approximated. In practice, the width of the vertical operators is almost
independent on its stretch size. Should that be a requirement of the
OpenType MATH specification?</p>

<p>In section <a href="S3.html#SS3.SSS9" title="3.3.9 Enclose Expression Inside Notation &lt;menclose&gt; ‣ 3.3 General Layout Schemata ‣ 3 Presentation Markup "><span>3.3.9</span></a> we describe the MathML <code>menclose</code> element. This
one contains many notations that are not mentioned in the OpenType MATH
specification. Some rendering suggestions are given based on the value of
<code>OverbarRuleThickness</code> but perhaps new values should be
introduced in the <code>MathConstants</code> subtable to cover these
notations.</p>
