  <p>This specification defines a core subset of Mathematical Markup Language,
  or MathML. MathML is a markup language for describing mathematical notation
  and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable
  mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just
  as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.</p>
