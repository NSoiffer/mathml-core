  <h1>Operator Dictionary</h1>


  <p>The following table gives the suggested dictionary of rendering
properties for operators, fences, separators, and accents in MathML, all of
which are represented by <code>mo</code> elements. For brevity,
all such elements will be called simply <q>operators</q> in this
Appendix.</p>

<section id="oper-dict_index"><h2>Indexing of the operator dictionary</h2>

<p>Note that the dictionary is indexed not just by the element
content, but by the element content and <code>form</code> attribute
value, together. Operators with more than one possible form have more
than one entry. The MathML specification describes how the renderer
chooses (<q>infers</q>) which form to use when no <code>form</code>
attribute is given; see <specref ref="presm_formdefval"/>. </p>

<p>Having made that choice, or with the <code>form</code> attribute
explicitly specified in the <code>&lt;mo&gt;</code> element's start
tag, the MathML renderer uses the remaining attributes from the
dictionary entry for the appropriate single form of that operator,
ignoring the entries for the other possible forms.</p>


<p>In the table below, all non-ASCII characters are represented by
XML-style hexadecimal numeric character references.
The choice of markup (character data, numeric character reference or named entity reference)
for a given character in MathML has no effect on its rendering.</p>

</section>


<section id="oper-dict_format"><h2>Format of operator dictionary entries</h2>

<p>Each row of the table is indexed as described above by the both the character
(given by code point and Unicode Name) and the value of the form attribute.
The fourth column gives the <kw>priority</kw> which as described in <a href="#">??</a>),
is significant for the proper grouping of sub-expressions using <code>mrow</code>.
The rule described
there is especially relevant to the automatic generation of MathML by
conversion from other formats for displayed mathematics, such as T<sub>E</sub>X,
which do not always specify how sub-expressions nest.</p>

<p>The length valued attributes such as <code>lspace</code> are given explicitly in the following columns.
Boolean valued attributes such as <code>stretchy</code> are specified together in the final <kw>Properties</kw>
column by listing the attribute name if its value should be set to <kw>true</kw> by the dictionary.
Finally some rarely used non-boolean properties are shown in the Properties column together with a value,
for example <code>linebreakstyle</code>=after.</p>

<p>Any attribute not listed for some entry has its default value,
which is given in parentheses in the table of attributes in <a href="#">??</a>.</p>

<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <th>(</th>
         <th>(</th>
         <th role="uname">left parenthesis</th>
         <th>prefix</th>
         <td>1</td>
         <td>0</td>
         <td>0</td>
         <td/>
         <td>fence<phrase>,</phrase> stretchy</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>

<p>could be expressed as an <code>mo</code> element by:
<pre><![CDATA[
<mo form="prefix" fence="true" stretchy="true" lspace="0em" rspace="0em"> ( </mo>
]]></pre>
(note the whitespace added around the content for readability;
Such whitespace will be ignored by a MathML system,
as described in <specref ref="fund_collapse" />.</p>

<p>This entry means that, for MathML renderers which use this
suggested operator dictionary, giving the element
<code>&lt;mo form="prefix"> ( &lt;/mo></code>
alone, or simply
<code>&lt;mo> ( &lt;/mo></code>
in a position for which
<code>form="prefix"</code>
would be inferred (see below), is equivalent to giving the element
with all attributes as shown above.</p>

<p>In some versions of this specification,
the rows of the table may be reordered by clicking on a h2ing in the top row,
to cause the table to be ordered by that column.</p>
</section>


<section id="oper-dict_space"><h2>Notes on <code>lspace</code> and 
<code>rspace</code> attributes</h2>

<p>The values for <code>lspace</code> and <code>rspace</code> given here range from 0 to 7,
they are given numerically in order to save space in the table,
the values should be taken as referring to the named mathematical spaces, as follows.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>Table Entry</td><td>Named Space</td><td>Default Length</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>0</td><td/><td>0 em</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>veryverythinmathspace</td>
<td>1/18 em</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>verythinmathspace</td>
<td>2/18 em</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>thinmathspace</td>
<td>3/18 em</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
 For the invisible operators whose content is <code>&amp;InvisibleTimes;</code>
 or <code>&amp;ApplyFunction;</code>,
it is suggested that MathML renderers choose spacing in a context-sensitive
way (which is an exception to the static values given in the following
table). For <code>&lt;mo>&amp;ApplyFunction;&lt;/mo></code>, the total
spacing (<attval>lspace</attval>+<attval>rspace</attval>) in
expressions such as <q>sin <i>x</i></q> (where the right operand
doesn't start with a fence) should be greater than zero; for
<code>&lt;mo>&amp;InvisibleTimes;&lt;/mo></code>, the total spacing
should be greater than zero when both operands (or the nearest tokens on
either side, if on the baseline) are identifiers displayed in a non-slanted
font (i.e.. under the suggested rules, when both operands are
multi-character identifiers).</p>
