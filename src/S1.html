<h2>Rationale for a new version of MathML</h2>

  <p>The <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11" title="">MathML3</a>]</cite>
    specification has
two serious shortcomings that make it hard to implement presentation MathML in
web rendering engines:</p>

<div id="mathml3diff.p3">
<ol id="I1">
<li id="I1.i1">
<div id="I1.i1.p1">
<p><span>The MathML 3 specification intentionally does not contain any detailed
rendering rules</span>. As a consequence, the fact that web rendering engines are
compliant with the MathML 3 specification does not necessarily mean that they
will have the rendering quality expected by most readers.
For example, the specification essentially just says that
“mfrac element is used for fractions” and that the default medium
linethickness “is left up to the rendering agent” <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11" title="">MathML3</a>]</cite>.
As a comparison, to determine the exact spacing and thickness of
fractions and stacks the
TeXBook’s Appendix G <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx16" title="">TeXBook</a>]</cite> relies on parameters
σ<sub>8</sub>, σ<sub>9</sub>, ξ<sub>8</sub>, 3ξ<sub>8</sub>, 7ξ<sub>8</sub>,
σ<sub>11</sub> and σ<sub>12</sub> while the MATH table of the Open Font Format
<cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13" title="">OpenFontFormat3</a>]</cite> extends these to parameters
<code>FractionNumeratorDisplayStyleShiftUp</code>,
<code>FractionNumeratorShiftUp</code>,
<code>FractionNumeratorDisplayStyleGapMin</code>,
<code>FractionNumeratorGapMin</code>,
<code>FractionRuleThickness</code>,
<code>FractionDenominatorDisplayStyleGapMin</code>,
<code>FractionDenominatorGapMin</code>,
<code>FractionDenominatorDisplayStyleShiftDown</code>,
<code>FractionDenominatorShiftDown</code>,
<code>StackTopDisplayStyleShiftUp</code>,
<code>StackTopShiftUp</code>,
<code>StackDisplayStyleGapMin</code>,
<code>StackGapMin</code>,
<code>StackBottomDisplayStyleShiftDown</code> and
<code>StackBottomShiftDown</code>.</p>

<p><span>The MathML 3 specification is designed as an independent
XML language and browser vendors have almost not been involved in the
standardization process</span>,
except for integration in <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx9" title="">HTML5</a>]</cite>.
The MathML 3 specification is sometimes biased by MathML rendering and
authoring tools behaving quite differently from web rendering engines.
Hence it is not always obvious whether all features are fundamental or
whether they fit well into the web rendering engine codebase.
For example, the <span>&lt;mfenced&gt;</span> element is just a
“convenient form in which to express common constructs involving fences”
but is strictly equivalent to an expanded form with <span>&lt;mrow&gt;</span> and
<span>&lt;mo&gt;</span> elements. It requires web rendering engines
to create many “anonymous”
rendering frames and keep them up-to-date, to duplicate the logic
for drawing and exposing the content of fenced expressions etc.
Another example is the first cell in a
<span>&lt;mlabeledtr&gt;</span> row which is not necessarily positioned the same way as
in HTML table and actually is supposed not to be involved in metric
computation or border drawing of the table <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx11" title="">MathML3</a>]</cite>.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="mathml3diff.p4">
<p>This "MathML Core" specification intends to address these issues by
being as accurate as
possible on the visual rendering of mathematical formulas using additional
rules from the TeXBook’s Appendix G <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx16" title="">TeXBook</a>]</cite> and from
the Open Font Format <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx13" title="">OpenFontFormat3</a>]</cite>.
Focus has been put on keeping compatible with existing technologies of web
rendering engines <cite>[<a href="bib.html#bibx9" title="">HTML5</a>]</cite> by relying as much as possible on CSS, text &amp;
table layout and box models. As a consequence, parts of MathML 3
that do not fit well in this framework or are rarely used in practice
have been ommited.</p>

<p>Future versions of this document may describe support for a larger subset
of presentation MathML by including features that are important in a web context
e.g. CSS-compatible line breaking.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.w3c-test.org/mathml/" title="">set of tests</a>

Browser vendors are encouraged to use these tests during
implementation &amp; automated testing. Contribution of new tests and error reports
