 <p>This section displays a non-normative Relax NG Schema which
 details the elements and attributes defined by this specification.
 Note that MathML does not need to be expressed in XML syntax, in
 particular the syntax defined by HTML may be used. However this
 schema may be taken as an informal specification of the structure,
 whatever syntax is used.</p>
